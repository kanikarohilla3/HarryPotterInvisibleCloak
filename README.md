Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that 
using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. 
This [code](AR_invisibility_Cloak.py) turns a `red` colour cloth into an invisibility cloak.

>- It's a fun application which you will enjoy using.
>- You can learn some key functions of opencv from this project. 
>- Refer a detailed [Tutorial](Tutorial.md) explaining the [code](AR_invisibility_Cloak.py).
